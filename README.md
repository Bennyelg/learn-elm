# learn `elm`

## Why?

We _already_ _know_ `JavaScript` and it is _still_ the
[_**most popular programming language**_](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology)
whereas `elm-lang` is not _even_ on the [_radar_](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016)
so _**Why**_ should we even _consider_ it?

The _reason_ you should be taking `elm` _seriously_ is _NOT_ because it's:
+ _**much faster**_ than React.js or Angular 2 in _all_ "[benchmarks](http://elm-lang.org/blog/blazing-fast-html-round-two)"
+ "_**pure**_" _functional style_ means there are fewer (_often zero_) ["_side effects_"]()

The the _reason_ we [@dwyl](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dwylsummer?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash) are _exploring_ the `elm` _ecosystem_ is because
it has a _shared vision_, _leadership_ and _community_.
These are a few of [our _favourite_ things](https://youtu.be/0IagRZBvLtw).



> It's _difficult_ to _introduce_ elm to someone
who has _never_ heard of it before without sounding "_evangelical_".



> It's equally _difficult_ to _overstate_ how _gamechanging_ `elm`,
the `elm-architecture` and `elm-platform` are to web development in 2016!


## What?

### `Elm` is a domain-specific programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. Elm is `purely functional`, and is developed with `emphasis` on `usability`, `performance`, and `robustness`. It advertises "`no runtime exceptions` in practice,"[3] made possible by the Elm compiler's `static type` checking.

### Isn't "Functional Programming" _Difficult_...?

If you `feel` like Functional Programming is "_complicated_" you aren't _alone_,
it's a _perfectly normal_ sentiment:

> I _tried_ functional programming in JavaScript before, it was _confusing_...

All we can say to that is:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don.27t_Panic)

_Trust_ us, the non-mathematicians without a Computer Science
or "Engineering" background _initially_ `felt` Functional Programming
was a _steep_ learning curve, because it's _quite_ different from
what we were _used_ to.

What we `found` was that the elm language is actually quite small
and when we break it down there are only a handful of concepts
we need to _understand_ before we can start reading/writing code.
